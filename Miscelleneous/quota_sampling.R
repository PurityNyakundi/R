## Description: Sampling data given different quotas
## I really hope this is what a reprex is 

## Let us assume that, from the infert data, we want to sample observations, such that
## the resulting data has 50% case=0 and 50% case=1, and an equal number
## of observations for each spontaneous category.

data <- infert

## Please insert the code below.
