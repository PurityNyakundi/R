## Commentary

##Hello from East Africa! I'm @Shel_Kariuki, from Nairobi, Kenya. I am so honoured to be curating this week.
## A few facts about me on this thread:
## 1/6: I co-organise #NairobiR, together with @kigen and @maronga.
## 2/6: I love #rstats. Maybe because I am paid to work with it everyday, so it pays my bills.
## 3/6: I used to be a university assistant lecturer, until a point where I realised that I needed to use my data skills to help solve real world problems. So I moved from academia to corporate.
## 4/6: I learnt a lot of r code from two of my former seniors, @fridah and @david (thanks guys).
## 5/6: I am priviledged to be an @zindi.africa ambassador for Kenya, where I further Zindi's mission of advancing data science in Africa.
## 6/6: I am also part of @AfricaRUsers, where our main mission is to advance R in Africa. Please follow us...

##Disclaimer:
##1. I know there are many ways of achieving the same results in R. I will be show casing the functions I frequently use, but feel free to comment with better alternatives. 
## I hope to learn a lot, by the end of the week.
##2. My rstudio screen is white. Please bare with me if you are pro black screen.

### 3.
##I want to thank all the amazing folks who have done this before me, and encouraged me to go for it... 
##@nic @vebash @Maggie @Shakyrah @lastone @Katherine. Thank you.. :hearts::hearts::hearts:

# Let me start with something I learnt the other day.
# Have you always wanted to include hyperlinks in R Markdown, so as to redirect folks to your github page, or any other personal page. 
# Well, this is how you do it.

### 5. The @hadley recently came up with a package that we could use to insert emojis into R and RMarkdown. Yeey!!

## 1. At times you work on a script, that will be used by others. It's highly 
## likely that they do not have all the packages used in the script, installed on their system.
## This code automatically installs packages that are not yet installed, and loads all of them at once.



## 1. Just the other day, I was running a piece of code, and it took forever. 
## I had to use a google stop watch to determine the time it took to run the code (It actually took 2 minutes, but oh well).
## A good friend of mine, Anto introduced me to the tictoc system. 
## He also introduced me to the beepr package. This package has a function beep() that plays a sound when the code is done running.
## Take a look

## 2. This year, I got a chance to attend @user2019. For those who attend conferences frequently, 
## what tips would you give a newbie conference attendee. 
## Let us call this "The Dos and Don'ts while attending a conference"
 
## 3. What is the best thing that you have learnt this year? For me, I am happy I got a chance to learn how to use the command line, 
## thanks to one of my former colleagues, Simon, and also thanks to @seankross book.


## 4. Am I the only one whose RStudo screen is white? Poll White Screen // Black Screen

## 5. It's night time in Kenya. I leave you with this amazing article: 
## How to create a culture of using R Programming at your institution . Goodnight!!

## 1. Every time I teach, I always try to match hand calculations with results obtained from R and Python.
## See this link for some work I did on one sample t-tests. @erm, see, I used reticulate..love

## 2. I am curious to know how people in other fields, except statistics, use R. Example, @willart uses
## R to develop amazing art. Anyone else?

## 3. datapasta

## 4. ggtheme is an addin that enables you to come up with awesome plots,
## without "craming" the gglot2 syntax.

## 5. Are there any aspects of code you struggle with? Personally, I struggle with complex regular expressions. 
## If anyone has "east to understand" material that I can go through, I would really appreciate



##******************Thursday 11th September, 2019*****************************************

##1. Writing functions in R

##2. Reading google sheet data into R via the googlesheets data

##3. Assuming you have 5 columns, a,b,c,d,e in a data frame, but you want to arrange them
## as a,b,e,c,d i.e insert e between b and c. One option would be data %>% select(a,b,e,c,d). 
## But assuming the columns were too many, which code can one use?

##4. Cron job scheduler

##******************Friday 12th September, 2019*****************************************

##1. Community organisers. How do you encourage people to attend your meetups. And how do you 
## deal with presence of begginers every time?

##2. Presentation of regression model results graphically

##3. Unfactoring variables / factors


##4.
