## 1) Generate an object in R, that contains the following values: 3,5,7,9,5. 
## Name this object myobject.

## 2) The area of a triangle is calculated as (1/2 * base * height). Given that we have a triangle
## with a base of 10cm, and a height of 8 cm, write an R code that we could use to calculate the area
## of this triangle.

## 3) Assuming that we have another triangle, with an area of 50cms squared, with a height of 7.5cm,
## Write an R code that can be used to calculate the width of the triangle.

## 4) Generate a dataframe that contains the name, gender and age of any 5 individuals.

## 5) Calculate the mean age of the   5 individuals, in the dataframe created in question 5.

## 6) Write a code that extracts the age of the individual on the 5th row, in the dataframe created
